# HARRO's nixos config

This is my take on the deepest rabbit hole I have ever fallen into, **nixos** configuration.

This config is suppose to be my ultimate modular and highly adaptable everyday config as a software engineer.
Its general structure is inspired on the brilliant [EmergentMind's config](https://github.com/EmergentMind/nix-config)

## Main features

- Multiple host configs in one place with shared bits of config
- Multiple user configs with [Home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
- Secrets management with [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)

## Documentation links

- [Setting up a new host](./doc/setting-up-a-new-host.md)
